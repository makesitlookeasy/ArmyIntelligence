Description:
    This game is modeled after the Deceiver in the Computer Science Field Guide,
    and is designed to game-ify the idea of keeping your interfacing consistant
    and meeting expectations

Installation Steps
    We used cordova to add the application to a tablet. Only touch controls are active
    at the moment, and keyboard control are enabled for testing, but without control switching.

Usage
    The runnable project for a local host is in FlappyDeceiver/FlappyDeceiver/ and
    refers to the index.html file.

Issues
    Only minor bugs:
        - keyboard checkmark always displays "check" when returning to options
        - in game mute option does the same as above ^

Future Plans
    - Implement keyboard control switching
        -> This would require creating more icons / visual indicator of the new controls
    - Some code for moving platforms, but they are not "sticky" (sprites do not track when on top)

Project resources
    - Music/SFX by Kenny Rosenberg
    - Bird spritesheet from/modified: http://opengameart.org/content/birds-spritesheet
    - Arrow keys and matching orb icon from Phaser example library assets
    - Speaker icons from: commons.wikimedia.org
    - Checkmark/Xmark -> I honestly forget, but I always search for images labeled for re-use
