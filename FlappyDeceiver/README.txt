Description:
    This game is modeled after the Deceiver in the Computer Science Field Guide,
    and is designed to game-ify the idea of keeping your interfacing consistant
    and meeting expectations

Installation Steps
    We used cordova to add the application to a tablet. Only touch controls are active
    at the moment, and keyboard control are enabled for testing, but without control switching.

Usage
    The runnable project for a local host is in FlappyDeceiver/FlappyDeceiver/ and
    refers to the index.html file.
